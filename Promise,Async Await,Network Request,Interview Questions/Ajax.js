//Basic Theory 

//Ajax :asynchronouse javascript and xML

//it is a aset of "web development techniques" using many web technology on the "client -side" to create asynchronouse web applications.

//with Ajax ,web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asyncronously(in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page


//http client aur server ke bich baat krne ka jariya

///client ->browser jo use krte hai js to get data from backend so we use js for frontend
//we don't use data in XML format anymore.
//we use JSON now

//we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server 
//xml HTTPRequest (old way of doing)
//2.fetch API(new way of doing)
//3.axios(this is third party library)
